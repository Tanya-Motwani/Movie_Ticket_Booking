KESARI is based on the true story of one of the bravest battles that India ever fought, the Battle of Saragarhi. The year is 1897 and the British Empire having conquered most of India, is now trying to infiltrate Afghanistan. Fort Saragarhi, in the NWFP (North Western Frontier Province) is a small communication post used to relay messages between two major military forts - Gullistan and Lockhardt. To be posted at Saragarhi is no matter of pride for the newly formed Sikh regiment of the British Indian Army.
